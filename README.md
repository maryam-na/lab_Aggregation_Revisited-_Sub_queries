In this lab, you will be using the Sakila database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official installation link.

Instructions
Write the SQL queries to answer the following questions:

Select the first name, last name, and email address of all the customers who have rented a movie.

What is the average payment made by each customer (display the customer id, customer name (concatenated), and the average payment made).

Select the name and email address of all the customers who have rented the "Action" movies.

Write the query using multiple join statements
Write the query using sub queries with multiple WHERE clause and IN condition
Verify if the above two queries produce the same results or not
Use the case statement to create a new column classifying existing columns as either or high value transactions based on the amount of payment. If the amount is between 0 and 2, label should be low and if the amount is between 2 and 4, the label should be medium, and if it is more than 4, then it should be high.
